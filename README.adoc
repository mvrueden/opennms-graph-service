= OpenNMS Graph Service Proof of Concept

The goal is to provide some new thing in to OpenNMS which is the single line of access to all Graph related operations.
The working title of this thing is `Graph Service`.

== Terminology

A *Graph* consists of any number of points with any number of connections in between.
Usually these points are called *Nodes*, but as *Nodes* have a specific meaning in OpenNMS in the context of the `Graph Service` they are called *Vertices* (plural of *Vertex*).
The connection between two *Vertices* are usually called *Link*, however it also has a specific meaning inside OpenNMS, thus it is called *Edge*.
The following figure shows a *Graph* with five *Vertices* and four *Edges*.

== Dilema

As the general concept of a graph with vertices and edges is pretty simple, each use case the graph represents may not be that trivial.
This leads to a very generic `Graph Model`, but on the other hand a very specific implementation.
This means the `Graph Model` should be easily shared between modules and applications (e.g. for visualization) but also
be able to be used for specific use-cases.
For example the BSM and Enlinkd model would share the same generic model, but under the hood be able to store specific information, thus allowing to write e.g. a very generic UI.

== Rules

Based on the dilemma, the following rules apply to provide a very loose model, but be able to provide full flexibility for implemtnations.

 - Each Graph must be uniquely identified.
   This identifier is called a `namespace`.
 - Each Vertex and Edge must be uniquely identified by an identifier.
   This identifier is called an `id`.
 - Each Vertex and Edge have the same `namespace` as the Graph they are part of.
 - Each Graph, Vertex or Edge have additional properties to define their nature in more detail.
   E.g. a Vertex may contain a `label`, `node` or `location` property.
 - Each Edge contains the source and target id of the Vertex it connects, therefore is ALWAYS directed.
